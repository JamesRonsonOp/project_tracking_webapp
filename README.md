# project_tracking_webapp
a custom project tracking web app using Python and Streamlit

### Project Description

This is a short and quick project that highlights the ease of using python, plotly and streamlit to deploy a web app. This web app is designed to take start time and end time as an input for a variety of project objectives for the purpose of project planning using a gantt-like time overlay. The functionality of this app is not extraordinary but I will likely add the ability to increase the number of objectives and add other feature customization capabilities. 

In the mean time this app will be used by a small start-up to plan feature importance and implementation.
